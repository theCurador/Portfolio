# BSN Basketball Stats Analysis with Predictive Modeling


The aim of this project is to analyze basketball stats for the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the professional basketball league in Puerto Rico. As a data scientist with domain expertise in sports, I am interested in scraping, analyzing, and visualizing the BSN basketball data to gain insights into team and player performance. Specifically, I want to explore the possibility of using the data to determine the plus/minus (+/-) rating of each player, which is a metric commonly used to evaluate a player's contribution to the team's success. Additionally, I will investigate other statistics that could be useful in improving team performance and player evaluation.

**Dataset**: *The BSN (Baloncesto Superior Nacional) is the professional basketball league in Puerto Rico. The dataset can be obtained from the official website of the league: http://bsnpr.com/estadisticas*

## Questions:

1. Can I pull the data from the **BSN** website?

2. What information can I analyze from the data, and how can I **improve** it?

3. Can I match up players based on their performance in various statistics, and **evaluate their contributions to the team's success**?

4. What information is **missing** from the **data**, and how can I obtain it?

## Tools:

- **Python**: *for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis*
- **BeautifulSoup**: *for web scraping*

- **SQL**: *for data storage and querying*

- **Matplotlib**: *for data visualization
Power BI: for interactive dashboards and reporting*

- **Scikit-learn**: *for machine learning and predictive modeling (if needed)*
